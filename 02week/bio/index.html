        <p> LeVerne started working for the Department of Banking as the System
          Support Specialist. LeVerne performed his duties admirably as he was tasked to
          support over 150 users within the agency.  That includes our
          Austin(Headquarters) and 4 regional offices.  In supporting the agency, he was
          responsible for training new users, setting up computers and computer
          accounts, assisting with network administration duties, tape backup, and a
          myriad of other "other-duties-as-assigned"
        </p>
        <p> LeVerne showed an interest early on to program.  During his spare time, he taught himself how to program
          in Powerbuilder.   He also took Oracle SQL college courses in order to improve
          his programming skills.  Human Resource Division was using a spreadsheet to
          record applicants and job announcements.  LeVerne developed an application
          using Access to record and maintain applicants' applications and job
          announcement.  Later, imported that data into the Oracle database and create
          an application for the end user.  LeVerne took on this task and still carried
          out his duties as the System Support Specialist.  As time went by, additional
          features was requested and implemented like automate letters to applicants,
          to automate the creation of database user accounts when an applicant is hired
          for a position,  property transfer/issuances, to name a few.
        </p>
        <p> Since being promoted to a Programmer in 2011, LeVerne has taken on applications from
          previous programmers and developed several of his own.  There are over 10
          desktop applications and 8 web applications that LeVerne is responsible for
          and is doing  an excellent job maintaining them.

        <p> Every year, surveys are sent out for 
          feedback on I.T. employees.  Every year, LeVerne receives almost 100%
          positive feedback.  He has been described as pleasant to work with, very
          patient, upbeat, friendly, can-do and willing to help attitude, timely,
          knowledgeable and "quick-to-find-a-solutions" to problems.
